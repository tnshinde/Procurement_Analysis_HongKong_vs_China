Welcome to the repository for my analysis of the Sport Obermeyer case study. This project delves into the operational and strategic decisions faced by Sport Obermeyer, a leading skiwear manufacturer, focusing on procurement, cost management, and forecasting techniques.

This repository includes detailed insights and models aimed at addressing the challenges of sourcing, production planning, and inventory management in a highly dynamic and unpredictable fashion industry.

üìå **Objectives**

Procurement Strategy: Compare the sourcing advantages and trade-offs between Hong Kong and China, considering costs, quality, flexibility, and operational efficiency.
Cost Optimization: Analyze FOB, labor, landed costs, and minimum order quantities to identify cost-saving opportunities and ensure profitability.
Forecasting Models: Apply advanced forecasting methods, including the Newsvendor Model and Coefficient of Variation (COV) approach, to balance inventory risks with demand uncertainty.
Hybrid Strategy Development: Craft a hybrid approach that combines risk-averse and profit-maximizing methods for better decision-making.

üìÇ Key Components

1. **Forecasting Techniques**

_COV-Based Approach:_

Allocates higher production to styles with lower uncertainty.
Cautious and suitable for reducing excess inventory risk.

_Newsvendor Model:_

Aggressively adjusts production to maximize profits by leveraging critical ratios and z-scores.
Optimized for high-demand scenarios.

_Hybrid Strategy:_
Blends the strengths of both models by assigning low-COV styles to the Newsvendor model and high-COV styles to the COV approach.
Provides a balanced production plan that minimizes risk while capturing potential profit opportunities.

2. **Procurement and Cost Analysis**

Comparison of production from Hong Kong and China based on:

Labor costs (China: $0.16/hour, Hong Kong: $3.84/hour).
Productivity and skill levels.
Quality differences and repair rates.
Minimum order quantities (Hong Kong: 600 units, China: 1,200 units).
Detailed cost breakdowns for FOB, landed costs, and logistics impact.

Hybrid production model combining the strengths of both locations to optimize costs while meeting quality and flexibility needs.

3. **Operational Strategy**
   
Addressed the "fashion gamble" inherent in early production decisions.
Developed strategies for reducing production lots to a 10,000-unit first-phase target.
Analyzed lead times and quota restrictions for strategic production planning.

4. **Inventory Management**
Explored pre-positioning of greige fabrics to handle long lead times.
Minimized risks of overstock and stockouts by aligning production schedules with demand patterns.
Optimized allocation decisions between regions to manage uncertainties in supply chain dynamics.

üîç **Case Study Context**
Sport Obermeyer, Ltd., established in Aspen, Colorado, is a high-end fashion skiwear manufacturer. The case revolves around the operational complexities of producing its 1993-1994 collection, particularly the challenges of demand forecasting, sourcing, and cost management amidst uncertain market dynamics. This repository documents an analysis of key decisions, including:

Early production planning without sufficient market feedback.
Balancing cost, flexibility, and quality in procurement strategies.
Risk mitigation in inventory and demand forecasting.

üìä **Data and Analysis**

Tools Used: Excel for data modeling, cost analysis, and forecast calculations.
Files Included:
Production and cost breakdowns.
Forecasting models (COV, Newsvendor, Hybrid).
Comparative analysis reports between Hong Kong and China.

üß† **Key Insights**

Hong Kong is better suited for smaller, high-demand uncertainty batches due to flexibility and quality.
China is optimal for large, predictable orders due to lower labor costs.
The hybrid approach significantly reduces inventory risk while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Early commitment to production quantities requires robust forecasting to manage trade-offs between understocking and overstocking costs.

üèÜ **Outcomes and Applications**
The insights from this case study offer valuable lessons in supply chain and operations management, particularly for industries dealing with high variability and fashion-driven trends. This analysis is highly relevant for:

Supply chain professionals exploring strategic sourcing and production planning.
MBA students and academicians interested in applying theoretical models to real-world problems.
Businesses in the fashion and apparel sector looking for effective demand planning and procurement strategies.
